    The basic CFRNN model as presented in Algorithm 1 of the accompanying paper.

    CFRNN training procedure entails training the underlying (auxiliary) model

    forecaster against the calibration dataset.

    The calibration is done by computing the empirical distribution of
    nonconformity scores (implemented via the `nonconformity`
    function), via the `calibrate` method.

    The AuxiliaryForecaster can be fit to the dataset from scratch, or,
    if the model path is provided, the model is loaded directly, its training is
    skipped and only the calibration procedure is carried out.

    Additional methods are provided for returning predictions: on the test
    example, the point prediction is done by the underlying
    `AuxiliaryForecaster`, and the horizon-specific critical calibration scores
    (obtained from the calibration procedure) are added to the point forecast to
    obtain the resulting interval. The coverage can be further evaluated by
    comparing the uncertainty intervals to the ground truth forecasts,
    returning joint and independent coverages and getting the errors from the
    point prediction.
